## Description

This program provides an API to be used for a social network, including routes for thoughts and users in a hypothetical social network. It uses Mongoose to sync models to the MongoDB database. The get routes get all of the users and thoughts, as well as each by id. The Post routes create new users and thoughts, as well as reactions to thoughts and friends to users. The put routes update thoughts and users by id. The delete routes delete thoughts and users, as well as delete friends within users and reactions within thoughts.

## Installation

Run "npm start" in the root of the program to start the server.

## Usage

Use the get, post, put, and delete routes to view, create, update and delete within Insomnia.
